Standing, by the side<br>
Let you go, on to the sea, just for me<br>
Don't ever limit my love<br>

Keep holding on<br>
Let the modest go<br>
As my mind goes to and fro<br>

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]<br>
How could you ever question? They know better to mention<br>
The Budget truck ain't just enough to make her pay attention<br>
The who, what, why, and where, they sport the flyest pairs<br>
She got the nicest hair, and she know life is better with this liquor<br>
It's crazy how the world look different<br>
It's crazy how the girls look different<br>
The colors and the sounds so vivid<br>
You never catch your boy bo-bimbin'<br>
Me sittin' on the sidewalk, now that don't sound right<br>
But as long as I look fly by prom night, go<br>

Every day, 20 K, yep, at the very least for sure<br>
And they say there's no way I should stay with someone like you<br>
But I tell them no<br>
There's no way I could stray, gotta stay with someone like you<br>
Cause I know one day, you could take me away, far away<br>
I know you could pay all the money you make<br>
There'll be plenty of sunshine<br>

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]<br>
When the world was with this and that<br>
I was young, didn't know to hold it back<br>
Now we here and the world is something else<br>
We could leave any day you call for help<br>
We were gods, nobody was above me<br>
That 'A' on my chest like adultery<br>
That 'A' on my chest, put your fist up<br>
That 'A' on my chest like a chipmunk<br>

Yeah, break free from all of the insides<br>
They godless, denied us<br>
But we don't give a damn about the next day<br>
We were never here, never know if the world change<br>
Common sense, the consequences<br>
Retweet the tweet then regret the mentions<br>
We are the wireless survivors of things gone<br>
Slaves to the unnamed, never live long<br>
Live and die by the line, never know fear<br>
Even I won't survive, is it unfair?<br>
Is it unfair? Cause I don't care<br>
When I step on that ant on the grass<br>
Progress the only thing that will last<br>
3005. The year that we fear, only God will survive<br>
To be alone is alive<br>

Rick Rolling these niggas, they mad cause they don't know any better<br>
Hold up, it's the kid, quick, tell him he can't sit with us<br>
Fuck it, got money, bought friends like I'm TBS<br>
VVS, I can see it all with the clarity<br>

Pulling on her weave<br>
It's that Andrew Auernheimer<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
We are the dreams of our parents lost in the future<br>
Who hide the deepest desires and wear a mask like a lucha-<br>
Door open, we were smoking in the hotel<br>
The vapors went through the hallway, the manager pissed as hell<br>
I mean where's the line between Donnie G and Gambino?<br>
He hang with girls like he Lena, but needed some time to re up<br>
Tequila in the cantina, 30 dollars I swallowed<br>
The sauce was so malo then she said 'you need to grow up<br>
You been doing this for too long<br>
That camp was a million years ago, sing me a different song'<br>
Whether you're trolling or controlling, just a reminder<br>
You think you get it, you don't, it's the Andrew Auernheimer<br>
I'm gone - now I'm back<br>
Give a fuck or give 'em hell, just not a chance to react<br>
Tyler Durden this burden, hurtin', they said there was curtains<br>
Certain demise, look in his eyes, the pain inadvertent<br>
I could've stayed where I was and have a life you'd be proud of<br>
But I'd rather chase things never thought of<br>
It was all love, saying 'go hard'<br>
Making dope, it's a trap, Ackbar backfired<br>
Panic dreams, so it seems we're meant to die<br>
I had to figure it out; 'it's the best,' no, that's a lie<br>
Had to get some stuff off my chest, I vaporized<br>
High on my own, it took time to realize<br>
Because the internet, mistakes are forever<br>
But if we fuck up on this journey at least we're together<br>
Man, I wish I could go back and tell that kid it's make-believe<br>
Make 'em believe in themselves, people who needed my help<br>
Feelings I felt, keeling myself<br>
No one's ever been this lost<br>
I just get the information retweeted or say it sucks<br>
I just got the motivation, your talent's just a bunch of luck<br>
Hard work and dedication, but lately it's run amok<br>
Waking up in these places I don't remember<br>
Texts from people I never met, doors left open<br>
(Who are you? Don't do it. Who are you?)<br>
I don't know who I am anymore<br>
Still on the beat though<br>
Still in the game, but he moves with a cheat code<br>
Slowest connection ever, my life inside a computer<br>
Them bands that'll make 'em dance, my wallet's Lollapalooza<br>
The violence, first-person shooter<br>
First person to move, first person to speak<br>
My mils aren't meek, they scream in the streets<br>
Losing my frame of reference, these pieces are shit with breakfast<br>
Funny the day you born that's really your death sentence<br>
I met this girl at a dinner, we conversating<br>
She beautiful in the face, but her voice is truly amazing<br>
And plus she write her own shit, becoming so close knit<br>
Smoke up and talking to eat, she helping me focus<br>
No Anna Nicole Smith, she getting hers<br>
Niggas taking props like a musical live and learn<br>
She say she feel alone all the time, I'm similar<br>
I meet her in my dreams on the moon, I visit her<br>
Every night I text her 'I wanna solve the world, I think I need your help'<br>
She text me 'how you gon' trust somebody when you don't trust yourself?'<br>
I mean she right though, 45 like a light-bulb<br>
And I could've died like my iPhone, but I kept going like a psycho<br>
And I took chance like a dice roll, dropping jewels like it's puberty<br>
Wrote a note on the glass, 'you see what these labels do to me'<br>
Texts said 'I'm Wet', I said 'hold up, wait up a minute'<br>
H2O plus my D, that's the hood I'm living in it<br>
Never forget this feeling, never gonna reach a million<br>
Eventually all my followers realize (If you downloaded the 'leaked' version the song/album stops here.) they don't need a leader<br>
Stay on your own shit, fuck what these clones think<br>
Just remember that you the shit, but act like it don't stink<br>
We were childish but had to grow up<br>
When you spitting real shit eventually you throw up<br>
Realities like allergies, I'm afraid to go nuts<br>
Life's the biggest troll but the joke is on us<br>
Yeah, the joke's you showed up<br>
